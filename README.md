## Paradise Arise
The year is 1909 and you're Tophat Sam, an infamous crook known for pulling off the most impossible of heists!
Sam's latest heist is the Lyssa, a famous cruise ship known for hosting the most lavish parties of the 0.01%.
Sam managed to escape by a hair, losing his plunder but not of his life or legendary cunning... yet!
Sam awakes, lying on his plank, washed up on a remote island in the middle of nowhere. As he looks around, there
are no signs of life...
Sam admires the landcape, pondering why such a marvelous landscape is so barren, until a BOOOOMMMMM! interrupts his thoughts.

Use the arrow keys on your computer to move around and press the space bar to jump across islands.
Avoid the disasters, don't fall into the water, and keep your hunger bar from emptying by consuming wild fruits until your 
partner in crime finds you. 

Don't let this be your last escapade. Good luck, Tophat Sam!
